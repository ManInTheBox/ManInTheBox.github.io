Hello, world!

This is my first, breakthrough, blog post. It's been a long time when I first started thinking about running my own technical blog.
There were few attempts, but none of them were successful. Here we are now, starting from scratch right here.

I really wanted this time something very basic and simple, a lightweight blogging platform to quickly help me start writing.
I've chosen [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to publish my blog posts which are hosted as Git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/ManInTheBox/ManInTheBox.github.io).
I use simple, but powerful, static site generator natively supported by GitHub Pages, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with its default theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) which perfectly fits my needs.
It can't be simpler than that. And I love it so much!

I'll try to write every once in a while when I have something to share. Stay tuned and I hope you'll come back again!

Cheers!
