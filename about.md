Hi there, thanks for visiting my blog!

![Žarko Stanković](/assets/zarko.jpg){:style="width: 150px; height: 150px; float: right; background-size: cover; border-radius: 50%;"}

My name is Žarko Stanković (pronounced [zǎːrko stǎːŋkoʋitɕ]). I am a software engineer from Belgrade, Serbia.
I'm a seasoned programmer, specialized in building backend systems with PHP. I tend to employ best practices
I learned throughout my 10 years old development career. I strive to learn new things every day, but always having
in mind that fundamental concepts are far more important than any newish buzzwords or the latest technology trends.
Try to understand _why_ the things work rather than _how_ they work.

I'm passionate about programming and doing Open Source commitments. I'm an active member of [PHP Serbia](https://phpsrbija.rs/),
PHP local user group from Serbia, and I'm occasionally involved in several Open Source projects.

I enjoy working as full-time employee at [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) - world's largest online chess community - responsible for building backend services in PHP.
One of bigger projects I did for Chess.com is our internal RESTful API which empowers our mobile applications.
Working with great people on the amazing project and trying to delight more than 20 million chess lovers is both joy and honor!

Besides being in front of my computer improving my software craftsmanship skills, I try to maintain a good work-life balance.
I love traveling with my girlfriend, playing guitar (I'm a big music lover!), running (member of Belgrade Running Club, ran half marathon once and few other shorter races),
reading books (non-technical as well) and spending time with friends and family!

I hope you enjoy my blog and have a good time! If you want to stay in touch with me, please drop me an email at stankovic.zarko@gmail.com
